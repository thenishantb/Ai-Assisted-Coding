Here's a breakdown:\n","\n","if num <= 1:: This checks if the input number (num) is less than or equal to 1. Prime numbers are defined as being greater than 1, so any number less than or equal to 1 is not prime, and the function returns False.\n","`for i in range(2, int(num0.5) + 1):**: This loop iterates through numbers starting from 2 up to the square root ofnum(inclusive). We only need to check for divisors up to the square root because if a numbernum` has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a divisor less than its square root.\n","if num % i == 0:: Inside the loop, this checks if num is divisible by the current number i (i.e., the remainder of the division is 0). If it is, it means num has a divisor other than 1 and itself, so it's not prime, and the function returns False.\n","return True: If the loop finishes without finding any divisors (meaning the if num % i == 0: condition was never met), it means the number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so it is prime, and the function returns True."],"metadata":{"id":"7odqs5bkuU-k"}}]}
